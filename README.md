# The Coin Game v.1.3
A board game played by two players in turns.

The objective of the game is to collect coins of greater value than the opponent. 
In each round a player selects a coin and the other player decides which player will get it. The first coin is selected by each player alternately. Each subsequent coin is selected by the player who holds the highest value of coins. If both players share the same value of coins then the next coin is selected by the player who selected a coin in the previous round.

The game was originally developed in Python then translated into Javascript. Content displayed and animations were made with DOM, HTML and CSS.
The game contains an easter egg! Can you find it?
